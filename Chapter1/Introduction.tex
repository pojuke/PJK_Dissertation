\section{General introduction}
What causes species diversity to vary among different places? Answers for this question can help sustain biodiversity and its stability, which has been a significant challenge under aggravating threat of species loss. In response, ecologists have devised a long list of theories to explain the maintenance of species diversity \citep{Vellend2016}. Community ecologists have expanded from the classic focus of species competition (e.g., \citealp{Gause1934}) to consider the effects of non-competitive interactions and multiple trophic levels (e.g., \citealp{Chesson2008b, Mccann2011, Bascompte2013}), thus better reflecting the complexity of natural systems. However, as multiple mechanisms operate simultaneously to shape species diversity, a general predictive framework would be difficult if theories continue to be developed with little crosstalk.

Plants and their soil microbial communities represent one association where the players are engaged in complex interactions that remain not fully explored. Plants interact with a wide variety of soil microbes, ranging from pathogenic to mutualistic microbes that have various degrees of host specificity \citep{Bever2010, Bever2012, vanderPutten2013}. Plants can also indirectly influence the performance of nearby competitors by modifying soil microbial communities, which is commonly studied under the framework of plant--soil feedback (\citealp{Bever1997, Bever2003}).
Moreover, these plant--soil microbe interactions are inherently age-dependent as it takes time for plants to condition the soil \citep{Kardol2013}, an aspect that remains rarely studied. Explicit consideration of the temporal dynamics of these interactions, however, can have critical implications in both natural and agricultural systems, guiding plant restoration, invasion control, and agricultural practices.
\par 


In this dissertation, I explore the complementarity of different frameworks for understanding species coexistence and, with plant--soil microbe association as an example, highlight the multi-trophic and age-dependent nature of ecological communities.

\section{Overview}
I start by exploring the theoretical and empirical relationships among modern coexistence theory and contemporary niche theory, which are two powerful frameworks for understanding the niche's role in species coexistence \citep{Chesson2000, Chase2003}. Contemporary niche theory provides a mechanistic framework considering how the resource supply ratio and trade-offs in the impact and requirement niches of competing species affect their coexistence; modern coexistence theory formularize coexistence as the balance between equalizing (i.e., lower fitness differences) and stabilizing (i.e., greater niche differences) forces. In Chapter 2, I ask how the criteria for coexistence under contemporary niche theory translate into the stabilizing and equalizing processes of modern coexistence theory. I show that varying resource supply ratios reflect an equalizing process; varying impact niche overlap reflects a stabilizing process; varying requirement niche overlap may be both stabilizing and equalizing, but has no qualitative effect on coexistence.
In Chapter 3, I extend the approach developed in Chapter 2 to discuss how priority effects, the phenomenon that the order in which species arrive affects competitive outcomes \citep{Fukami2015}, fit within the stabilizing and equalizing concepts of modern coexistence theory. I argue that the only compatible priority effects are those characterized by positive frequency dependence, irrespective of whether they emerge in equilibrium or non-equilibrium systems.
By exploring the connections among different frameworks of species coexistence, the two chapters together lay a foundation for further conceptual advances for more complicated interactions.
\par


In Chapter 4, I ask how the interactions between plants and soil microbes influence plant coexistence. It is known that systems vary in the impacts microbes have on plants and in the ways plants compete with each other, rendering a general predictive theory difficult \citep{Lekberg2018}. Building on the previous two chapters, I argue that the concepts of niche and fitness difference from modern coexistence theory should be used to contextualize how soil microbes contribute to plant coexistence \citep{KeMiki2015}. 
With a general plant--soil microbe interaction model, I show that, depending on host-specificity, both pathogens and mutualists can affect the niche difference between competing plants. Moreover, soil microbes can affect plant fitness differences and modify the importance of plant--plant competition for determining plant coexistence, a role that is often overlooked by the literature. I then propose experimental designs that can efficiently measure both plant--soil microbe and plant--plant interactions. With an empirical case study, I demonstrate how the proposed predictive framework can provide a better way to identify the actual processes through which soil microbes affect plant coexistence.
\par


In Chapter 5 and 6, I explore the temporal dimension of plant--soil microbe interactions at Bodega Bay, a coastal foredune community dominated by four perennial species: the introduced grass \textit{Ammophila arenaria} (Poaceae), the introduced succulent dwarf-shrub \textit{Carpobrotus edulis} (Aizoaceae), and the native shrubs \textit{Baccharis pilularis} (Asteraceae) and \textit{Lupinus arboreus} (Fabaceae). I use a series of high-resolution aerial photos, which were taken annually from 1992 to 2016, to estimate the age of individual plants \citep{Danin1998}. From the age estimations, I reconstruct a chronosequence of soil conditioning length, ranging between 1 to 11 years for \textit{L. arboreus} and between 2 to 25 years for the other three species.
In Chapter 5, I examine the successional dynamics of soil fungal communities associated with \textit{C. edulis} and \textit{L. arboreus}. By collecting soil from plant individuals along the chronosequence, and re-sampling a subset of individuals for three consecutive years, I test the hypothesis that a deterministic force structures fungal communities and drives their convergence \citep{Connell1977, DiniAndreote2015, Li2016}. 
I show that the beta diversity among fungal communities decreased and our ability to predict their composition increased as plants aged. I argue that the combination of chronosequence and longitudinal data strengthened the inference of an underlying deterministic process shaping soil fungal communities.
\par 


Despite our growing knowledge on the successional dynamics of soil microbes, how their effects on plants vary through time remains rarely studied \citep{Kardol2013, Lepinay2018}. This is presumably because preparing soils with different conditioning lengths is often not feasible in the greenhouse \citep{Kardol2013, Kulmatiski2018}, and the length of soil conditioning in the field can only be quantified with coarse resolution (e.g., \citealp{Day2015, Speek2015}). 
Taking advantage of the chronosequence, in Chapter 6 I study the turnover of soil microbial communities associated with the four dominant perennial plants at Bodega Bay. I then design a greenhouse experiment that preserved age-specific microbial communities to study how their turnover affected plant performance.
I show that compositional turnovers of soil microbes translated into temporally varying plant--soil microbe interactions, and different plant--soil combinations showed different temporal development patterns. 
Using a general individual-based model, I further show that the temporal development patterns of microbial effects affected the transient dynamics of plant community assembly. 
With the combination of high-throughput sequencing, greenhouse experiment, and simulation models, Chapter 5 and 6 together develop a dynamic perspective of plant--soil feedback to understand their long-term consequences on plant community dynamics.

\section{Overall conclusion and future perspectives}
\begin{comment}
Since the beginning of community ecology as a sub-discipline, the phenomenological Lotka--Volterra competition model has offered first-order approximation for understanding species competitive outcome. My dissertation, taken together, highlights the effects of non-competitive multi-trophic level interactions and age-specific interactions on species coexistence.
Our modeling framework in Chapter 4 can be applied to other trophic levels that encompass a variety of species interaction type.
In Chapter 6, we see changes in interaction strength with soil conditioning length. This is also a general phenomenon that applies to almost all multi-cellular organisms.
Temporal development of PSF has a strong effect on the transient dynamics, indicating a broad spectrum of interesting interactions among temporal dynamics.
Building from here, my future work will study the interaction among different time scales.

% Modern coexistence theory and contemporary niche theory represent parallel frameworks for understanding the niche's role in species coexistence. Despite increasing prominence and shared goals, their compatibility and complementarity have received little attention. This paucity of overlap not only presents an obstacle to newcomers to the field, but it also precludes further conceptual advances at their interface. Here, we present a synthetic treatment of the two frameworks. We review their main concepts and explore their theoretical and empirical relationship, focusing on how the resource supply ratio, impact niche, and requirement niche of contemporary niche theory translate into the stabilizing and equalizing processes of modern coexistence theory. We show for a general consumer--resource model that varying resource supply ratios reflects an equalizing process; varying impact niche overlap reflects a stabilizing process; and varying requirement niche overlap may be both stabilizing and equalizing, but has no qualitative effect on coexistence. These generalizations provide mechanistic insight into modern coexistence theory, while also clarifying the role of contemporary niche theory's impacts and requirements in mediating coexistence. From an empirical perspective, we recommend a hierarchical approach, in which quantification of the strength of stabilizing mechanisms is used to guide more focused investigation into the underlying niche factors determining species coexistence. Future research that considers alternative assumptions, including different forms of species interaction, spatio-temporal heterogeneity, and priority effects, would facilitate a more complete synthesis of the two frameworks.

%Priority effects are commonly invoked to describe a broad suite of phenomena capturing the influence of species arrival order on the diversity, composition and function of ecological communities. Several studies have suggested reframing priority effects around the stabilizing and equalizing concepts of coexistence theory. We show that the only compatible priority effects are those characterized by positive frequency dependence, irrespective of whether they emerge in equilibrium or non-equilibrium systems.

% Growing evidence shows that soil microbes affect plant coexistence in a variety of systems. However, since these systems vary in the impacts microbes have on plants and in the ways plants compete with each other, it is challenging to integrate results into a general predictive theory. To this end, we suggest that the concepts of niche and fitness difference from modern coexistence theory should be used to contextualize how soil microbes contribute to plant coexistence. Synthesizing a range of mechanisms under a general plant--soil microbe interaction model, we show that, depending on host-specificity, both pathogens and mutualists can affect the niche difference between competing plants. However, we emphasize the need to also consider the effect of soil microbes on plant fitness differences, a role often overlooked when examining their role in plant coexistence. Additionally, since our framework predicts that soil microbes modify the importance of plant--plant competition relative to other factors for determining the outcome of competition, we suggest that experimental work should simultaneously quantify microbial effects and plant competition. Thus, we propose experimental designs that efficiently measure both processes and show how our framework can be applied to identify the underlying drivers of coexistence. Using an empirical case study, we demonstrate that the processes driving coexistence can be counterintuitive, and that our general predictive framework provides a better way to identify the true processes through which soil microbes affect coexistence.

% Plant--soil feedbacks (PSF), the reciprocal interactions between plants and soil microbes, shape the structure of plant communities, but how the length of soil conditioning affects PSF strength is rarely studied. Using a chronosequence reconstructed from aerial photos, we characterized the soil microbial communities associated with four perennial dune plants and their turnover as plants aged. We also studied the resulting PSF in a greenhouse experiment that preserved age-specific soil properties. For all plants, we found that their microbial communities changed with increasing conditioning time. These compositional turnovers translated into a temporally varying PSF, and different plant--soil combinations showed different temporal development patterns. With an general individual-based model, we further found that the temporal development patterns of PSF affected the convergence rate of plant community assembly. Our results suggest that future studies should take a dynamic perspective to understand the long-term consequences of PSF on plant community dynamics.
